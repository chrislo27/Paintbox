# Paintbox

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/chrislo27/paintbox.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#chrislo27/paintbox)

A collection of utilities on top of [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) 
with a custom UI scenegraph. Not really intended to be used generally.

Notably used in the [Polyrhythm Mania game](https://github.com/chrislo27/PolyrhythmMania),
a full re-creation and more of a GBA minigame.
