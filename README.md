A collection of utilities on top of [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) 
with a custom UI scenegraph. Not really intended to be used generally.

Notably used in the [Polyrhythm Mania game](https://github.com/chrislo27/PolyrhythmMania),
a reimagining of a specific GBA minigame from *Rhythm Tengoku* if it were a fully-fledged game. 

### Note on this branch (`0-4-stable`)
This is a branch for the 0.4.x version line, for Polyrhythm Mania only. I intend to update the 0.4.x version line to libGDX 1.10.1 (specifically the next version *after* 1.10.0) due to [bug #24](https://github.com/chrislo27/PolyrhythmMania/issues/24), related to an old GLFW version.
