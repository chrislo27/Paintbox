A collection of utilities on top of [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) 
with a custom UI scenegraph system. Not really intended to be used generally 
since documentation is spotty + lack of a stability guarantee.

Notably used in the 2021 [Polyrhythm Mania game](https://github.com/chrislo27/PolyrhythmMania),
a reimagining of a specific GBA minigame from *Rhythm Tengoku* if it were a fully-fledged game,
which was my first "full" game project.
